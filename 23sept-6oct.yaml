title: Running toward WikiToLearn 1.0

message_short: How's the work going for the incoming 1.0 release? Let's find out!

message : |
    Here we go with the first, hoping of a long series, of our Reports! These two weeks were amazing, because
    we can feel that WikiToLearn 1.0 is about to be released and we are extremely excited for this! In these two
    weeks we had the possibility to bring WikiToLearn to India. Srijan, with the help of the promo team, organized
    the first WikiToLearn editathon and made Amrita University sign the first official Memorandum of Understanding
    between a University and WikiToLearn. Tech team is coding more and more to provide you the 1.0 in the best possible
    way: 217 different commits on our repos! Courses have just begun, and you can see it by the huge number of new edits
    on the site: 2576 edits, for a total of 302 new pages! For this we also have to thank Tunale: CourseEditor is simply
    amazing and it provides a fantastic editing experience. Let the countdown begin, WikiToLearn 1.0 is coming!
